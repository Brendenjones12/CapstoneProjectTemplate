# Deployment

## Server
For iteration 1, we had the multi-page website hosted on a Apache2 Ubuntu server located locally on ball state.

## File/Folders
The php and singular html files all need to be located in the same folder.

## Start/Stop
To start the website, have the server load the "login-page.php".

## Trouble Shoot
If you run into errors, your best bet will be to look at the server's console or the error log of the program running the php.

## Critical Pieces to Fail
The most critical piece that could fail would be "connect.php", because it is used by almost all the php pages.
