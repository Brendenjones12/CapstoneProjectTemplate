Other than just running through the website and looking at both the professor and student side, you can use the chat bot by going through this process

1. type in the chatbot field "I have a question about a class"

2. When it asks what the class ID is, type "1"

3. Then type one of the relevant syllabus question row headers, like "officeHours" or "contactInformation"

4. it should give you an answer relevant to the question, like "MWF 1pm-5pm" or "Email: jsmith@bsu.edu", which can be checked against the mysql database
