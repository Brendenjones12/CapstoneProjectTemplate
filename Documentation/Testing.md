# Testing

## How to Test the Software:
To test the software in its current form (iteration 4), you need to have the latest version of PHPUnit installed and runnable directly in your command_line (or another similar tool). 
Currently, you also need to go through the pages being tested and look for a call to a "getEnrolledCourses" method and comment that out before running the unit tests.

## Do You Need To Replicate The Environment?
- XAMPP
  - Needed to run the apache server and the mysql server.
- PHPUnit
  - Needed to run the phpunit tests.
